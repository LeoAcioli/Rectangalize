# Rectangalize-Objects-in-Image
Program that detects objects within a given image, and puts those objects within a rectangle that respects the object's edges. 
This program IGNORES objects that are too small and the edges of the picture itself. The output should tell how many rectangles are 
there in the image. Just say the name of the image on the command prompt, and it will automatically be saved in your computer.

#Pre-Requisites
install Numpy, install cv2, Python, and functional IDE. Use a picture, and it should save the picture with the detected rectangles/
objects.
